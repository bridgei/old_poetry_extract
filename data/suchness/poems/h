Body = [<title>From the park walk today … – Suchness1</title>]Body = Already I can see damage to more than a few trees, even some fallen ones. Ahead a young beech tree has succumbed to the weight of the rains. Broken, it lies across the path. A fledgling blackbird sits on the gravel amidst broken branches, basking in a pool of morning sunlight. We walk around, dog and I.

Felled tree
Roosting spot no more —
Only rain

Meadow grass
White clover sprinkles
Dew glistens

Woodland glade’s sunbeams
Hopping blackbird stops, listens —
Raindrops pattering
